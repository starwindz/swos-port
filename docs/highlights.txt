New format is introduced:
- complete 32-bit coordinates are saved (both whole and fractional part versus only whole in original)
- game time and stats are also saved and shown each frame if needed
- limit of 10 scenes per highlight file is removed
- highlight scene buffer is increased so the saved scene length remains approximately the same even with
  additional data

Highlights are now, as replays, saved to their separate directory, called "highlights".

Scene data buffer starts with a scene offset table. It's an array of start and end offsets (dwords) marking
scene start and end in the buffer that follows. Offsets are relative to the start of the buffer. There are as
many start-end pairs as there are scenes.

   0        4   offset to scene data start

Data buffer:
   ?       ??   Buffer holding the scene data consists of frames. Each frame consists of:
                - [0]  dword: offset of the next frame (relative to the scene buffer start)
                - [4]  dword: offset of the previous frame ( -||- )
                - [8]  2 dwords: camera coordinates, x and y
                - [16] 2 words, number of goals for team 1 and 2
                - [20] 3 bytes: game time digit 1, 2, 3 (BCD)
                - [23] byte: reserved

                Array of "replay objects" follow, until the next frame beginning.

                If the high bit of picture index is set, it's stats data in the following form:
                - word: ball possession
                - word: goal attempts
                - word: shots on target
                - word: number of corners won
                - word: number of fouls conceded
                - word: number of bookings
                - word: number of sendings off

                If the highest bit isn't set, the object is a sprite, comprising of following data:
                - dword: picture index
                - dword: x
                - dword: y

When saving replay file scene offset table is saved with it, so the highlights can be played as well.


Keyboard shortcuts during the replay:
- left/right:                   skip forward/backward
- ctrl + left/right:            large skip
- ctrl + alt + left/right:      extra large skip
- shift + left/right:           skip single frame (best when paused)
- R:                            slow motion replay (50% speed)
- F:                            fast mode replay (200% speed)
- I:                            toggle info display
- , (comma):                    go to previous scene
- . (dot):                      go to next scene

These shortcuts, with the exception of 'R' and 'F', are not available during the game.
