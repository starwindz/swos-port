- Data alignment
  Data isn't aligned naturally for 32-bit Intel CPU (4 bytes), as SWOS was conversion from 68k, seems it was
  aligned on 2 byte boundary (one example is highlights buffer which is an array of dwords but is only word
  aligned). Additionally, each change to data segment might disbalance it further.
  On 64-bit processors this could represent even more startling problem.

- Refactoring
  Right now we're forced to replace SWOS procedures one by one, but once enough of them gets replaced, a
  refactoring could take place into until more satisfying code structure is achieved.
