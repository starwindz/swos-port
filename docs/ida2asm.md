# `ida2asm`

`ida2asm` is a tool for converting pseudo-assembly output from IDA Pro into
something that can actually be assembled/compiled without errors.

Even though it started as an assembler conversion tool it can now generate C++ output in addition to the
basic MASM x86 format which has even become obsolete. Having multiple output formats was an idea from the start
so it was designed to be easily augmented.

Aside from the conversion, second task is symbol manipulation (importing, exporting, removing, etc.). This is
specified via a custom format input text file.

## Command-line parameters

`ida2asm` expects 6 command line parameters, in the following order:
- path to the exported input ASM file from IDA
- directory path for output files (it will be extracted if a file path is given)
- path to input control file
- path to output C++ header with exported symbols
- output format (currently only `masm` and `c++` are supported)
- number of files to split output files (as well as how many threads to use), maximum is 20

Optional parameters are also accepted, they start with two dashes, and are currently only valid for
C++ output:

`--extra-memory-size=<size>` - statically allocate memory of given size

`--disable-optimizations` - disable conversion-time optimizations

Short help can be listed by passing `-h` or `--help` parameter. See more about optimizations in [Optimizations
section](#optimizations).

## Input file

Input file controls how the conversion to the actual output files will be performed. It consists of sections
which begin with '`@`' sign. Following sections are supported:
- `@import`
- `@export`
- `@remove`
- `@null`
- `@replace`
- `@save-regs`
- `@on-enter`
- `@insert-hook`
- `@constant-to-variable`
- `@type-sizes`

Any line beginning with `#` sign is considered a comment and will not be processed.

### `@import` section

The purpose of `@import` section is to replace assembly procedures with functions from C++. Any non-empty line
is treated as a procedure name that will be imported from C++. C++ functions do not take any parameters and
by default return `void`, unless symbol name is followed by a comma followed by `int` -- in that case return
type is `int`. Assembly procedure body is removed from generated assembly code, and its name is treated as an
extern label. All the imported C++ functions are listed in the generated header file, declared as
`extern "C"` inside `SWOS` namespace.

For example, following lines in input file:
```
@import
ExitEuropeanChampionshipMenu
GetFilenameAndExtension, int
```

Would produce the following in the resulting header:
```
extern "C" {
    namespace SWOS {
        extern void ExitEuropeanChampionshipMenu();
        extern int GetFilenameAndExtension();
    }
}
```

### `@export` section

`@export` section contains a list of symbols that are exported from the assembly and will be accessible from
C++ via the generated header file. Inside assembly files they will be prefixed with underscore, and made
public. Syntax for exporting symbols is:
```
<symbol> [, function |, (array | pointer | ptr | functionPointer) <type>['['<size>']'] |, <type>] [(align: <n>)]
```

SWOS assembly file contains a large amount of symbols, and limiting exports to only the used ones helps
improving compiling and linking performance, as well as minimizing name clashes.

Examples:

```
g_menuMusic, int16_t                            # becomes: int16_t g_menuMusic
skipIntro, word                                 # becomes: word skipIntro
dosMemLinAdr, char *                            # becomes: char *dosMemLinAdr
FadeOutToBlack, function                        # becomes: void FadeOutToBlack();
hilFileBuffer, array char                       # becomes: char hilFileBuffer[1];
keyBuffer, array char[10]                       # becomes: char keyBuffer[10];
introTeamChantIndices, array const int8_t[16]   # becomes: const int8_t introTeamChantIndices[16];
sortedSprites, array Player * [79]              # becomes: Player *sortedSprites[79]
spriteGraphicsPtr, array SpriteGraphics *(*)    # becomes: SpriteGraphics *(*spriteGraphicsPtr)[1];
g_currentMenu, array char[6500] (align: 4)      # becomes: char g_currentMenu[6500]; (with 4 byte alignment)
```

`align` modifier can be used to manually specify the alignment of the variable in bytes.

### `@remove` section

`@remove` section contains a list of functions and variables that will be completely removed from the
resulting output files. It's commonly used to get rid of DOS-specific code, unused code/data and items
made obsolete by new portable C++ code.

To remove a range of symbols specify beginning and ending symbol separated by a `-` (minus) sign.
Ranges are semi-open, just like in C++ so listing

```
CDROM_GetInfo - Text2Sprite
```

will remove `CDROM_GetInfo` and everything following it up to but not including `Text2Sprite`.

Special symbol `@end` can be used as an end of range, specifying removal until the end of the section.

### `@null` section

Any procedure name listed in `@null` section will be turned into null proc, consisting of `retn` only.
It is recommended to remove unnecessary symbols, but sometimes it's not feasible as the symbol might be
referenced from many places in the code. In such cases large functions can be temporarily
nullified until all the code that references them can be removed.

### `@replace` section

This section enables replacing initial values of variables, as well as sizes of arrays. It will replace listed
variable content (after size specifier) with text specified after the comma. For example:

```
aQuitToDos, 'QUIT TO WINDOWS', 0
# original:   aQuitToDos db 'QUIT TO DOS',0
# changes to: aQuitToDos db 'QUIT TO WINDOWS', 0
g_soundOff, 0
# original:   g_soundOff dw 1
# changes to: g_soundOff dw 0
hilFilename, 256 dup(0)
# original:   hilFilename db 14 dup(0)
# changes to: hilFilename db 256 dup(0)
```

### `@save-regs` section

Since SWOS was written in assembly language it uses CPU registers freely, which can create problems when SWOS
procedures are called from C++. Many functions destroy contents of registers C++ compilers assume will not
change throughout a function call. In order to call SWOS code safely for each listed procedure instructions
will be injected that save and restore registers C++ compiler considers nonvolatile.

Care has to be exercised as `push` and `pop` instructions are injected at the beginning of the proc, and
before the final `retn`, without code flow analysis. This can cause crashes if used with functions that
have multiple exit points. `SAFE_INVOOKE` macro can be used to call such functions.

This section is ignored when converting to C++ files.

### `@on-enter` section

For each procedure listed in this section a function call will be inserted as a first instruction. Name of this
function will be procedure name concatenated with `_OnEnter`. For example:
```
InitGame    # first instruction of InitGame will be call InitGame_OnEnter
```

On the C++ side parameterless `void` function inside a SWOS namespace will be declared in output header file,
`SWOS::InitGame_OnEnter()` for the example above.

### `@insert-hook` section

Lines in this section have the following form:
```
<proc name>, <line number>[, <hook name>]
```

Inside each procedure at a specified line number a call will be inserted to `<hook name>`, or to the
function in the form of `<proc name>_<line number>` if hook name wasn't given. For example:

```
GameLoop, 224
PlayerDoingHeader, 157, PlayHeaderComment
```

will cause a `call GameLoop_224` to be inserted at line 224 of `GameLoop` and `call PlayHeaderComment` at line 157
of `PlayerDoingHeader` procedure. Previous content that comes after inserted lines is shifted one line above, e.g.
old lines 224 and 157 become new lines 225 and 158, respectively. On the C++ side, `SWOS::GameLoop_224()` and
`SWOS::PlayHeaderComment()` will be  declared in the output header file.

It is also possible to remove lines. To do so specify special hook name `@remove` at a line that needs to
be removed.

There are no limitations in number of hooks per procedure, as long as each line corresponds to exactly
one hook.

### `@constant-to-variable` section

Sometimes it is required to use a variable instead of a constant. That can be achieved by adding a line in this
section with the following format:

```
<proc name>, <line number>, <variable name>, <constant value>
```

Procedure name and line number uniquely identify a line with constant access. Line number is counted from the
beginning of the procedure, starting with 1. If the specified line does not hold an instruction using a constant
value, or a constant value does not match a specified value, an error will be reported. Supplied constant value
isn't strictly necessary, but it helps validating it's the right line.

`ida2asm` will replace the constant with a variable when generating output. Given variable will be added to the
end of SWOS data memory and initialized with original constant value. The variable will appear as any other SWOS
variable, and can be accessed with `swos.<variable name>` syntax. Variable name is expected to be valid and unique
in this context.

For example:
```
UpdateCameraBreakMode, 8, penaltiesInterval, 110
```
will generate instruction:
```
cmp penaltiesTimer, penaltiesInterval
```
in place of:
```
cmp penaltiesTimer, 110
```
and a variable `penaltiesInterval` will be added to SWOS variables and initialized to 110.

Note that this is technically invalid code in x86 assembly, since there is no addressing mode capable of moving
data between two memory locations. However the code generator will handle it properly and generate correct
assignment.

### `@type-sizes` section

This section is only valid for C++ output. In order to properly create structure containing all the SWOS
variables `ida2asm` must know the sizes of all types. Any type that can't be deduced from the input files
must be specified here.

This section is currently only used when outputting C++ files.

## `no-break` markers

`ida2asm` can be instructed to create multiple output files, breaking original file in several places in
the process. While care is taken that no procedures are broken apart, it can still happen with some data
tables or procedures that are expected to be consecutive. In such situations special markers in the source
code are introduced: "`; ${no-break`" begins protected block, "`; $no-break}`" ends it. Example usage:
```
; ${no-break
; this is important filenames table
db 'importantFileName1', 0
db 'importantFileName2', 0
db 'importantFileName3', 0
; $no-break}

; ${no-break
proc Proc1
    ; some logic
    ; no retn instruction, continue executing Proc2
endp
proc Proc2
    ; more logic
    retn
endp
; $no-break}

```

## 68k registers

Variables A0-A6 and D0-D7 are handled specially. They represent registers of virtual Motorola 68k CPU, and
are declared as instances of special templated class which offers a plethora of ways of accessing it
(as a byte, word, dword, pointer etc.). The variables will be automatically available in the generated
header file.

## Output

### Verbatim

Verbatim output simply outputs gathered input as is, without any additional processing. Its primary use is for
testing, and as a starting point when implementing new output formats.

### MASM output

_**MASM output has been deprecated. It is still present, but lacks any new features.**_

By using MASM output format the pseudo-assembly input is converted to proper MASM 32-bit syntax that can be
assembled with MASM version 8.00.50727.104. Older versions would probably work too, but this one has been
extensively tested. Limitations are that only the systems running on 32-bit Intel processors are supported, and
there are no optimizations on the output files -- it is practically a one-to-one conversion of the input
instructions.

### C++ output

C++ output is the main output format of the application. The gathered input (x86 instructions) is translated to a
compilable C++ code, backed by the SWOS Virtual Machine™ runtime. The code is highly portable and can run on
virtually any system supported by a C++ compiler. Generated output files are:

- `swossym.h`
- `vm.cpp`
- `vm.h`
- `swos*.cpp` (e.g. `swos-01.cpp`, `swos-02.cpp`...)

`swossym.h` is a support header containing SWOS namespace, `Register` struct definition used for 68k register set,
function prototypes (for both SWOS code -> external code and external code -> SWOS code), `ida2asm`-introduced
variables and some compile-time checks.

`vm.cpp` and `vm.h` contain implementation of the SWOS Virtual Machine™, which will be further explained.
`swos*.cpp` files contain the actual SWOS binary code, converted to C++ that runs in the SWOS Virtual Machine™.
The number of files is decided by the command line parameter.

#### SWOS Virtual Machine™

SWOS Virtual Machine™ is a static (compile-time) emulator of Intel x86 instructions, and is the target for
`ida2asm` C++ output. It supplies the Intel 80386 register set and flags as global variables and a SWOS memory
address space where all the game's data resides. There is also a small runtime component that manages memory
access, ensures proper alignment and supports inter-operation with the external code, residing in `vm.cpp`.

Each instruction is translated when the input file is processed and converted to one or more C++ statements.
CPU register access is converted to global variable access, and memory access to VM data area access. Generated
statements update the virtual CPU state in the same way as the original instructions.

Since it's a compile-time emulator custom tailored to SWOS, and implements only a minimal subset of x86
instruction set required to run the game, it is able to achieve much higher performance than a general purpose
dynamic emulator would. Also, it's able to exploit very good optimization capabilities of modern C++ compilers
that will compile the generated code, although it does implement a few optimizations of its own. Thus the
generated code has excellent performance, very close to native.

TODO:
- vars struct
    - memory address space, accessing
    - wanted to remove the offsets(in comments), but left them (very useful for debugging)
- procs/handling of proc pointers
- namespaces: SWOS and SwosVM
- memory allocation
- alignment
- `SwosDataPointer<>`
- `SwosProcPointer`

#### Memory layout

Entire SWOS data area is laid out in an array linearly, thus resolving problems with non-consecutive locations in
assembly version -- when segmented assembly files were linked, linker would realign them and sometimes these
alignment bytes would fall inside SWOS tables and areas that are expected to be contiguous.

Memory space is divided into 4 parts. First part contains variables from the game -- the game's data area. Second
part holds the extended memory the game allocates from the DOS extender. Third part is so called "pointer pool
area", an array of native pointers and the way native memory can be accessed from within the game. Fourth part
holds memory which can be allocated to clients outside the virtual machine.

Each part is separated by a "safe area", filled with a fixed byte pattern. Checking if this pattern is intact can
discover memory overwrites. It's a curiosity that the first safe area (at offset 0) had to be modified to have the
first four bytes zeroed out, to emulate DOS/Amiga behavior since there are some null pointer accesses in the
original game (or perhaps the conversion, but it's not clear) that rely on getting zero value to work properly.

Memory layout diagram:
```
  +---------------+
  |   safe area   |
  +---------------+
  |   basic mem   |    (all the variables)
  +---------------+
  |   safe area   |
  +---------------+
  |  extended mem |    (memory the game allocates from the OS)
  +---------------+
  |   safe area   |
  +---------------+
  | pointer pool  |    (native pointers, pointing outside the SWOS VM)
  |     area      |
  +---------------+
  |   safe area   |
  +---------------+
  |  dynamic mem  |    (memory allocated by the code outside the SWOS VM)
  |  (allocated)  |
  +---------------+
  |   safe area   |
  +---------------+
```

#### Access by external code

SWOS variables are grouped inside one big C++ `struct SwosVariables`. It maps one-to-one to location of each
variable when overlayed on top of SWOS memory data array. For convenience `swos.<variable>` macro is provided, so
for example it's enough to write:
```
swos.chosenTactics = -1;
```

to read/write variables. Types are preserved, so arrays or structs can be used freely:
```
swos.importTacticsFilename[0] = 0;
const auto& positions = swos.positionsTable[tactics];
if (swos.ballSprite.y >= kPitchCenterY) ...
if (swos.topTeamData.playerNumber != m_playerNumber) ...
```

Registers are instances of special class `Register` which has some special sauce:
```
pointer access, conversions... [TODO]
```

Registers and flags are inside the `SwosVM` namespace and can be accessed as normal variables:
```
SwosVM::eax++;
SwosVM::ax = swos.gameCanceled;
SwosVM::flags.zero = !SwosVM::ax;
```
-flags struct (4 bool flags)

#### Alignment

One thing external code has to look out for is the data alignment. SWOS very often accesses unaligned data since
the Intel processor allows that. To be portable across platforms that don't support unaligned access, or have high
performance penalty, care must be taken.

SWOS pointers, alignment... [TODO]

Note that the code inside the SWOS Virtual Machine™ is safe, as the VM automatically splits unaligned access into several aligned accesses.

#### Pointer pool area

Sometimes there's a need to pass outside data to a code running inside the virtual machine, or execute some new
non-game code inside it that needs outside memory access. SWOS is a 32-bit program using 32-bit pointers, so on a
32-bit system native and VM pointers are interchangeable and can be passed around freely, but running on a 64-bit
system poses a challenge.

To address this, pointer pool was introduced. It is a list of native pointers that can be used by the VM code.
Special 32-bit VM pointers are created that are actually indices into the pointer pool with the highest bit set.
Virtual machine detects these special pointers when trying to access the memory, and translates them
appropriately. This way code inside the VM is allowed to break free and access host memory.

Code that needs to access native memory doesn't need to know how this mechanism works. There is an interface
function to register a native pointer:
```
dword SwosVM::registerPointer(const void *ptr);
```
It will register a native pointer `ptr` inside the pool pointer area, and return a 32-bit pointer valid inside the
virtual machine. Virtual machine will dereference a given native pointer each time a returned VM pointer is
accessed. In case of an error the function returns -1: if `ptr` is null or if the pointer pool is full.

One example of usage is in menu system: string tables contain a pointer to an index of the currently selected
string, which gets updated by the user actions. Without pool pointers it would be very difficult to create any new
string table and seamlessly support this functionality.

It could also be used if some game buffers accessed via pointers would need to be extended: all it would take
would be to initialize those pointers with registered pool pointers tied to larger buffers outside the VM.

#### Function pointers

;

TODO:

- allocating/releasing VM memory (all the functions in header)
`vm.h` contains declarations of ...
- read/writeMemory (normally only used by VM itself)
- registerProc (for example, as a menu handler callback)
- g_memWord;
- g_memDword;

#### Optimizations

Currently, the C++ generator performs three types of optimizations:

- redundant flag setting removal
- redundant assignment removal
- orphaned assignment removal

;

TODO:
- planned/possible further optimizations (that compiler can't do), slightly stepping in decompiler area
- elimination of code helps with compiling speed
- redundancies in generated x86 SWOS code

In case the optimizations are undesired, they can be disabled by supplying command line parameter
`--disable-optimizations`.

## Performance

First version of the `ida2asm` was written in Python, with the goal of getting the results as quick as
possible. This impacted performances negatively, resulting in processing times of 1 minute and upward. It was
extremely harmful for productivity as assembly files generation needed to be run fairly often, especially at
the beginning of the project.

That's how second parser version came to be, written in C++ with ultimate performance in mind. This approach
is reflected in a specially constructed tokenizer (see next section), minimization of heap allocations,
cache-friendly structures and multi-threaded parser.

The end result was stunning: ~30ms on average to process 250k lines `swos.asm` on an i7-7700K :)

Many lessons were learned along the way. Importance of measuring can not be overstated. Low performance of
`std::unordered_map` and `std::isspace()` was surprising but undeniable.

### `gen-lookup`

`gen-lookup` is a Python script that will generate C++ function for tokenizing. It constructs it from input
file `tokens.lst` which contain informations about the instruction set. The generated function is a kind
of prefix tree encoded in the code (via switch or if statements). Example simplified pseudo-output would be:
```
// p -> input
...
if (*p++ == 'm')
  if (*p++ == 'o')
    if (*p++ == 'v')
      if (isDelimiter(*p)) return MOV
      else if (*p++ == 's')
        if (isDelimiter(*p)) return MOVS
        else if (*p++ == 'b')
          if (isDelimiter(*p)) return MOVSB
        else if (*p++ == 'd')
          if (isDelimiter(*p)) return MOVSD
        else if (*p++ == 'w')
          if (isDelimiter(*p)) return MOVSW
        else if (*p++ == 'x')
          if (isDelimiter(*p)) return MOVSX
...
```

It was selected by winning a "performance war" against a few alternatives:

* looking up tokens via `std::unordered_map`
* looking up tokens via custom hash map
* looking up tokens via `gperf` generated table and lookup function

State machine variants using ifs and switches were also tested. Project token-lookup-tester generates the
tester which was used to measure performance. Here's an output from one run on my machine:

```
Number of collisions for std::unordered_map: 65
Number of collisions for custom hash: 19

Time for state machine (switch): 73ms
Time for state machine (ifs): 79ms
Time for std::unordered_map: 145ms
Time for custom hash function: 128ms
Time for gperf generated lookup: 80ms
```

The interested ones can look further into token-lookup-tester project, and run the executable to see how
the performance results might look like on their machines.

### Parallel processing

Parsing of the input file and further processing and output is split and given to separate threads to process
in parallel. Their number can be specified from the command line.

The input file can not be trivially split at random points. Each thread has to determine start and end of its
block, given only rough offset.

Since no locks or other synchronization primitives are used each thread is responsible of finding the safe
limits of its part. They all use the same algorithm of what to skip and where to begin/end and thus arrive
at mutually exclusive limits covering entire file.

First step is to ensure no lines are broken. Then the chunks are tokenized (with some additional buffer
before/after) and it is further assured that no procedure is broken or any `no-break` block.

Parsing begins after the hard block limits have been established.

### Data oriented programming
TODO

`ida2asm` uses mostly custom data structures, designed to maximize data locality. Any variable parts (e.g.
strings) follow immediately after the structure.

## Hacks and quirks

`ida2asm`, although fairly general tool, is quite tied to SWOS, and contains some peculiarities and
workarounds for weirdness in IDA syntax. Namely, support for virtual Amiga registers, as well as removal
of unaligned stack access and IDA never marking struct variables as such.

Still, adapting it for a novel purpose would likely be much easier than starting from scratch.

## Changing the output format to other assembler than MASM

Output is created by a class that inherits abstract base class `OutputWriter`. `OutputWriter` handles
writing to the actual output file and exposes set of output functions for the inherited classes to use.
Descendant class will be created by the factory and given access to all the stored data from parsing.
Its task is to use this data and the given interface to generate a valid assembly file.

`VerbatimOutput` is an example output class that will output all the input "as is". It's a very useful
tool for testing and can be a good place to start when trying to figure out how things work.

For portability do not output new line directly. Use `out(Util::kNewLine)` instead. Use `out(kIndent)` to
start an indented line. Base class will handle the rest, as well as tabs.
