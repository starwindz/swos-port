- replay files contain the whole game, not just a few short scenes like highlights
- however they are internally implemented as one big highlight
- in the menus, they were added side-by-side with highlights and support the same operations
- loading replay file will overwrite current highlights; opposite is not true
- if auto save replay option is on, replay file will be saved even if the game is exited via alt-F1
- on the other hand, if there is no current replay, or it was already auto-saved, it shouldn't be saved again
- some cases for testing:
  - very short replay file (<19kb)
  - very short replay file with 'R' instant replay pressed
  - loading hil file should not disable current replay
  - loading rpl file should disable current hil
  - SWOS++ bug should be gone (condensed replays files when playing multiple friendlies via "replay" menu)
  - saving replays after loading highlights
  - loading and saving replay file should result in an identical file
  - viewing same replay after the game vs. from loaded file
  - auto-save shouldn't trigger multiple times
  - auto-save shouldn't trigger when no replay data
  - bench shouldn't disturb the recording
  - spamming 'R' during the game shouldn't disturb the recording (vary interrupted and full replays)
  - games with no data (escape pressed immediately at start) should be handled gracefully
- one note for the future fixes: length of hil file header is 3,626 bytes, which isn't divisible by 4, but
  dword replay data buffer immediately follows (making it improperly aligned)
