   6      2     some player speed
  48      2     goalkeeper catching the ball chance, 0..15
                if random value (bits 4..7 of currentGameTick) is less than this, goalkeeper catches the ball
                so the bigger the value, the greater the chance of catching (15 = 93.75%)
  52      2     0..15
  54      2     0..15 ..maybe?
  58      2     0..15
